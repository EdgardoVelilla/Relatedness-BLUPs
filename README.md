# Relatedness & BLUPs: Supplementary Material for Efficient Prediction of Dominance Effects in Large Breeding Populations

## Overview
This repository is a comprehensive resource containing essential supplementary material for the research paper "Efficient Prediction of Dominance Effects in Large Breeding Populations: Unveiling the Power of Mixed-Model Methodology." The provided materials consist of a collection of R functions specifically developed to enhance the research pipeline. These functions support breeding program simulations and genetic evaluations focusing on quantitative traits.

## Features

### Breeding Program Simulations
The functions included in this repository enable the simulation of a breeding program for a quantitative trait using stochastic simulation based on an infinitesimal model (Fisher 1918; Bulmer 1980). The simulations incorporate both additive and dominance genetic effects, while assuming negligible contributions from epistatic sources of variance. The simulation process involves the following steps:

1. **Base Population**: Founder individuals are sampled from an ideal random mating base population, characterized by no inbreeding and Hardy-Weinberg linkage equilibrium.

2. **First-Generation Simulation**: Open-pollinated progenies representing half-sib families are generated. Selection is then performed based on the best-performing half-sib families.

3. **Subsequent Generations**: Parents undergo random mating through a half-diallel design. The additive genetic effects is computed based on parental values and the additive Mendelian sampling deviation. Furthermore, an individual's dominance genetic effect, adjusted for the average effect of inbreeding on the mean, is computed following the method described by Hoeschele & VanRaden (1991).

4. **Phenotypic Value Simulation**: Phenotypic values are simulated by adding the expected mean phenotypic value in the first generation, as well as additive and dominance effects, inbreeding depression, and environmental factors.

### Genetic Relatedness Matrices

In addition to the breeding program simulations, this repository provides specific functions to build genetic relatedness matrices for a given pedigree. These include:
*	The full-sib family genetic relatedness matrix (F), which is based on the expected fraternity coefficients using either Jacquard's condensed coefficients of identity (Jacquard, 1974) or the coefficients of coancestry (Hoeschele and VanRaden, 1991).
*	The genetic dominance relatedness matrix (D), which uses the expected fraternity coefficients based on Jacquard's condensed coefficients of identity (Jacquard, 1974) or the coefficients of coancestry (Hoeschele and VanRaden, 1991).
