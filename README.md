# Relatedness & BLUPs
## Supplementary Material 

This repository contains supplementary material for the "Efficient Prediction of Dominance Effects in Large Breeding Populations: Unveiling the Power of Mixed-Model Methodology" research paper. This supplementary material provides a collection of additional R functions to enhance the research pipeline. The provided functions facilitate breeding program simulations and genetic evaluations for quantitative traits.

## Features

### Breeding Program Simulations

*	Simulate breeding programs for quantitative traits based on the infinitesimal model (Fisher
1918; Bulmer 1980).
*	Incorporate both additive and dominance effects to model the genetic architecture of traits.
*	Utilize stochastic simulation techniques to mimic realistic breeding population dynamics.

### Genetic Relatedness Matrices
Generate the dominance- and family-relatedness matrices using two approaches:
*	Jacquard's nine condensed coefficients of identity (Jacquard, 1974) which quantify accuratelly the genetic relationships among individuals.
*	Coancestry coefficients based on the approach by Cockerham (1954).

### Predictions
Get the best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE) and best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) by solving the mixed model equations under an animal model (Henderson, 1950).

## Usage
To use the functions, follow these steps:
* Install R programming language (https://www.r-project.org/) and ensure it is properly set up.
* Clone or download this repository.
* Load the required functions into your R environment using the appropriate import statements.
Refer to the documentation and examples provided within each function to understand the input requirements and usage guidelines.
